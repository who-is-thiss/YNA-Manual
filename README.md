# YNA Coding Manual
A YNA Coding Manual so you can learn how to create your own tags.

## Installation
You will need:
1. A Discord Server with the 42 Bot (You can invite her using this link: https://42.rockett.space/join)
2. The latest release of the **Manual.** (Click on releases.)

Open your server, and run the following command: `+tag create manual`. Before sending the message, attach your .yna file to it. Then, send the message.
If everything was done properly, you should get a confirmation message. Now, you can run `+tag manual` to use the Manual!

## Updating
It's super easy to update.
All you have to do is download the new release, and instead of `+tag create manual`, use `+tag edit manual` and attatch the new file with the update.
